# Creating Basic AI Agents

This guide walks you through building simple AI agents from scratch, illustrating core concepts like perception, decision-making, and action. We cover both a reactive agent and a deliberative (task-planning) agent using Python.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* **Libraries:**

  * `openai` (for LLM-based agents)
  * `requests` (for API calls)
  * `networkx` (optional, for planning graphs)
* **API Keys:** An OpenAI API key if you plan to use an LLM for decision-making.

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai requests networkx
```
